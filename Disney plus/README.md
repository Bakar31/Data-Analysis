## About this Dataset: 
Disney+ is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have close to 1300 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 116M Subscribers globally. This tabular dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Amazon Prime, along with details such as - cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc.

## My Approach:
I did some basic analysis with `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` libraries to get a clear idea about Disney+ and their contents.
